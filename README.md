# Neighborhood Map

[Click here] (https://rajiv-shankar.github.io/Udacity-FEND-Project-5/) for a map of my neighborhood, with the places I visit most often.  Click on the flags or the list of places for information about the location and a link to its Wikipedia entry.  Or search for the place and then click on the entry.  Refresh the page to start over.  The site is responsive to run on mobiles and tablets, as well.
